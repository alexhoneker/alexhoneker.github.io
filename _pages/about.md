#### Welcome! 

I am a Lecturer in the Department of Political Science at <a href='https://www.clemson.edu/cbshs/departments/political-science/'>Clemson University</a>. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href='https://www.qatar.tamu.edu/academics/arts-and-sciences/'>Texas A&M University at Qatar</a>. I received my PhD in Political Science from the <a href='https://www.polisci.pitt.edu/'>University of Pittsburgh</a>. I hold a B.A. in Political Science from the <a href='https://olemiss.edu/'>University of Mississippi</a> and an M.A. in Public Policy from <a href='https://www.utdt.edu/'>Universidad Torcuato Di Tella</a>.

My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior, international political economy, and party politics. I explore individual attitudes and party competition on globalization-related issues, with a special focus on international trade and economic globalization. I explore these topics with a regional focus on Europe and the United States, and employing survey experiments, observational data, and quantitative text analysis.

My work has been published in the *Review of International Political Economy*, *Party Politics*, and *Foreign Policy Analysis*, and is forthcoming in *Electoral Studies*. <br><br>
