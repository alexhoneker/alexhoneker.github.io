  title={This land is our land: Radical right parties and the environmental issue in Europe},
  author={Honeker, Alex, and Spoon, Jae-Jae},
  abstract={Recent research has demonstrated that non-mainstream parties are expanding their issue emphasis beyond their owned issues. In this article, we expand this research to understand radical right parties’ environmental issue emphasis and what explains this increasing emphasis. We argue that radical right parties engage in a two-pronged strategy of responsiveness and differentiation on the environment. In response to green parties’ and the public’s increase in environmental salience and green parties’ polling success, radical right parties increase their emphasis on both the environment more generally and on environmental chauvinism, a particular nationalist brand of environmentalism. We demonstrate this using Twitter/X data from radical right parties in Western Europe from 2019 to 2021. These findings have important implications for understanding issue evolution and party competition in the changing party systems of Europe.},

  title={Do Parties Matter? Party Positions and European Voters’ Attitudes Toward Economic and Political Globalization},
  author={Honeker, Alex},
  abstract={To what extent do party positions influence voters’ attitudes toward the economic and political aspects of globalization? Initially an issue following a left-right dimension of conflict, globalization increasingly divides mainstream from nonmainstream parties. In this study, I argue that parties help citizens form opinions on globalization issues. I then use data on voters’ attitudes and party positions on globalization to test this supply-side theory of globalization attitudes on both economic and political dimensions. Holding demand-side factors such as economic self-interest and predispositions/values constant, I find that party positions strongly affect voters’ views on economic and political globalization, with the effect being similar to that of education. Moreover, I find that the effect of cues from left- and right-populist parties is much more negative than that of mainstream parties, replicating previous elite-level findings on the positioning of these party families. Finally, green party cues show conflicting results for the economic and political dimensions, with green cues affecting voters negatively on economic globalization but positively on political globalization. The findings in this study call for a deeper exploration of the supply-side determinants of globalization attitudes.},

  title={Pro-trade nationalists and protectionist xenophobes? The conditional effects of psychological factors on trade attitudes},
  author={Honeker, Alex},
  abstract={To what extent do psychological factors determine individuals’ support for trade? Previous studies find that predispositions such as nationalism, patriotism, xenophobia, and isolationism predict opposition to imports. However, it is unclear whether this relationship holds when trade is framed in ways other than imports and for international institutions (IIs) governing trade between countries. In this study, I use a cross-national dataset to test whether the relationship between psychological factors and trade/II attitudes is conditional on the frame used (imports vs. consumer choice vs. neutral), the dimension of trade (principle of free trade vs. IIs governing trade), and the level of political integration of trade-related IIs (deep vs. shallow). Controlling for self-interest factors and other covariates, I find that, while xenophobia consistently predicts protectionism regardless of the frame and dimension, and patriotism mostly predicts trade/II support, the effect of nationalism and isolationism highly depends on the frame used. Moreover, the negative effect of xenophobia and isolationism on support for trade-related IIs increases as they become deeper. The findings in this study call for a greater exploration on how the interaction between elite framing and psychological predispositions affects attitudes towards trade and other globalization issues.},
